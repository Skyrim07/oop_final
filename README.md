Our **Bike Rental Management System** is a GUI application designed to streamline the process of renting and managing bikes. By providing an intuitive visual platform, the system simplifies how renters browse, search, book, and manage rentals, reducing the hassle associated with traditional manual processes. For administrators, it offers easy-to-use tools to efficiently manage inventory, track bike availability, and handle booking requests, ensuring seamless operations and optimal resource utilization. The system is designed to deliver a user-friendly experience that caters to diverse needs while fostering convenience and accessibility.


This system uses a text-based database to manage bike and booking information, ensuring that data storage is straightforward, lightweight, and easy to read or write. Additionally, the system is built using object-oriented programming principles, which promote modularity, scalability, and reusability. By organizing the application into objects representing entities such as bikes, bookings, and GUI panels, the design ensures clear separation of concerns and logical relationships between components. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend as new features or functionalities are added.
